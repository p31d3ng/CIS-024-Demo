# CIS-024 Python Programming Sample Repository

You can put anything in this README file, it doesn't matter, but in your `main` branch, there should be only one file "README.md"

You should have 4 different branchs

- week_1
- week_2
- week_3
- week_4

Each branch should contains your weekly assignment's python scripts(s) (bascially just copy & paste them from Replit to Github) but should not contain anything else!

For exmaple, in your week_1 branch, I should only see

```
README.md
main.py (can be in any name, but it should contain your week 1 assignment code ONLY)
```

You can navigate this repo and select different branch and see what I mean!
