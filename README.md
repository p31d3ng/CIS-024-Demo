# CIS-024 Python Programming Sample Repository

You can put anything in this README file, it doesn't matter, but in your `main` branch, there should be only one file "README.md"

You should have at least one more branch, which contains one of your weekly assignment

- week_1
- week_2
- week_3
- week_4

Bascially all you need to do is just to copy & paste them from Replit to Github

For exmaple, if you chose to upload your first week's assginment, I'm expecting seeing a branch named `week_1`, and in your `week_1` branch, I should see

```
README.md
main.py (can be in any name, but it should contain your week 1 assignment code ONLY)
```

You can navigate this repo and select between `main` and `week_1` branch and see what I mean!
